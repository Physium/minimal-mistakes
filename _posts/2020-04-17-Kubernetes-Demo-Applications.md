A few months ago, I had the chance to be involved in a couple of [Pivotal Container Services (PKS)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/1-7/index.html) with NSX-T proof-of-concepts (POC). The thing about these POCs is that it’s really more than just getting the platform up and running. Often times, it requires running some applications in order to validate if the platform is working as expected, and if the necessary integrations are in place. The kind of applications you need will depend on the test cases required.

Hence, I thought it’d be a good idea to compile and share some of the Kubernetes applications that I utilize often. I’ve included the YAML files as well as links to other community developed Kubernetes applications. Do check it out below!

Happy running ```kubectl apply -f``` !
