## Work From Home...
Well hello there! It has been awhile since I last wrote something. Given that the things are slowly down for a bit due to this COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and everyone is now forced to work from home, I thought... why not take some time to blog about something light to get myself into the mood to start blogging again. 

I've been wanting to do some sort of a "year in review" post since the start of this year but I just could never really get my lazy self to do it. Now that with zero travelling and slightly more time on hands, I figured that this is a good time to reflect and review how my the last 2 and a half years at VMware have been.

## Life as an Sales Engineer in VMware
After graduating from the sales academy program, my role as an SE was more of an ad hoc role. I was given the chance to rotate around and work with the different SE business units. It was extremely fun and stressful at times as I was constantly pushed out of my comfort zone. This was the period where I had the opportunity to really understand how VMware as a business is being ran from different angles.  

About a year in, I was then re-assigned to work on a new initiative from the company which is to run a replica of VMware's Executive Briefing Center (EBC) locally in Singapore. The idea is for Singapore to be the hub for Southeast Asia and Korea (SEAK) where customers can come over and gain first hand experience of VMware's solution portfolio. This further widen my  had the opportunity to work with a wider group of people ranging from solution architects to specialist to curate and deliver content to the C-Level.

Fast forward to the start of FY20, I was finally given a territory to focus on. I was privilege to be paired up with an extremely seasoned sales to tackle the given patch of accounts. I have to admit that it was initially pretty daunting as I was overwhelmed with the level competency that is expected of me. Thankfully my sales was understanding enough to guide me along the way and I manage to settle in pretty quickly. Taking on a full on an Account SE role is a huge change in terms of what I was doing previously. There is now a level of ownership given when it comes to managing your accounts. At the end of the day, the goal is to get customers treating you as a trusted advisor when it comes to their digital initiatives. This truly marks the start of my journey as an SE and it will definitely not stop here.

Happy to say, I was awarded my first vExpert star last year and my second star this year! One of the main reasons why I started this blog was to use it as an opportunity to document my learnings and eventually share it to the wider community. Thou theres still a lot more work on the frequency and the type content, I see this as a motivation to keep working on producing content from time to time.

Blogging aside, I also had the opportunity to return to my alma mater yearly as a guest speaker to share insights on the IT industry. This initiative first started at VMware a couple of years ago by a senior who also came from the same alma meter and wanted to collaborate with the professors to create some form of industry sharing curriculum for the students. This gave us platform for us to educate and share with the students what VMware do as a company and also what we do for the company.

I'm glad that VMware has a program that recognizes external contributions and I definitely hope to keep this going.

## Hands-on Lab, VMworld 2019 San Francisco & Barcelona

The highlight of the year would definitely goes to me having the opportunity to work for the Hands-on Lab team. If you are not familiar with the VMware's Hands-on Lab offerings, its essentially a website that allows anyone to test drive a wide selection of VMware's latest solution offerings FOR FREE!

It was a pleasure working alongside a huge group of liked minded people globally who enjoys building labs for the community to learn, test and explore. As the Hands-on Lab program is run by a small group of core members, in order to make it work at a large scale setting and it heavily relies on the wider VMware team to volunteer their time outside of their day job to contribute to this program.

As part of the Hands-on Lab team for building the labs, we would also get the opportunity to go to both VMworlds to support and showcase the labs that we have build. Needless to say, I was blown away at scale of the event that was delivered and the passionate attendees who soak themselves in the spirit of VMworld to learn and share together.

## Moving Forward
I'm almost coming to my 3rd year in VMware now and I have to say I am truly humbled to be given the chance to work at this company and experience a journey like this. Being able to see how VMware grew from a company that focuses heavily on software virtualization into cloud business and now into the application and security space is truly mind blowing for me. The level of speed and innovation that goes behind the scenes to deliver products that helps customers with their digital transformation initiative is what allows me as an SE to stand in front of my customers and sell that vision of Any Cloud, Any App, Any Device.
