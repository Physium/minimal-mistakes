## Work From Home...
Well hello there! It has been awhile since I last wrote something. Given that we welcome the year 2020, I thought why not hope on the bandwagon and write a about a year in review. Interestingly enough it was on this exact same date last year that I had the same idea to write something to welcome the new year.

## Life as an Sales Engineer in VMware
After graduating from the sales academy program, my role as an SE was more of an adhoc role. I was given the chance to rotate around and work with the different SE business units. It was extremely fun and stressful at times as I had the opportunity to understand how VMware as a business is being ran from different angles. I also got to experience whats an entire sales cycle like.

About a year in, I was then re-assgined to work on a new initative from the company which is to run a replica of VMware's Executive Briefing Center (EBC) locally in Singapore. The idea is for Singapore to be the hub for SEAK where customers can come over and get first hands experience of VMware's solution portfolio. I had the opportunity to work with a wider group of people ranging from solution architects to specialist to curate and deliver content to the C-Level.

Fast foward to the start of FY20, I was finally given a terrority to focus on. I was priviledge to be paired up with an extremely seasoned sales to tackle the given patch of accounts. I have to admit that it was initaly pretty daunting as I was overwhelmed with the level competency that is expected of me. Thankfully my sales was understanding enough to guide me along the way and I manage to settle in pretty quickly. Being an Account SE is a huge change in terms of what I was doing previously. There is now a level of ownership given to you to build, run and manage the accounts ensuring that your customers treat you as a trusted advisor when it comes to its digital initatives. This truly marks the start of my journey as an SE and it will definitely not stop here.

Happy to say, I was awarded my first vExpert star last year and my second star this year! One of the main reasons why I started this blog was to use this as an opportuntiy to document my learnings and eventually share it to the wider community. Thou theres still alot more work on the frequency and the type content, I see this as a motivation to keep working on producing content.

Blogging aside, I also had the opportunity to return to my alma mater as a guest speaker. This was an initative from a senior at VMware who came from the same alma mater as me. We used this is a platform to educate and share with the current batch of undergrads on what VMware do as company and how our technology plays a part in enabling digital tranformation across various industries. 

I'm truly thankful that vExpert community recognizes the contributions that i have done and cheers to another year of giving back!

The highlight of the year would definitly goes to me having the opportunity to work for the Hands-on Lab team. If you arent familar with the VMware's Hands-on Lab offerings, its essentially a website that allows anyone to testdrive a wide selection of VMware's latest solution offerings FOR FREE!

It was a pleasure working alongside a huge group of liked minded people globally who enjoys build labs for the community to learn, test and explore. As the Hands-on Lab pogram is run by a small group of core members, in order to make it work at a large scale setting and it heavily relies on the wider VMware team to volunteer their time outside of their day job to contribute to this program.

As part of the Hands-on Lab team for building the labs, we would also get the opportunity to go to both VMworlds to support and showcase the labs that we have build. Needless to say, I was blown away at scale of the event that was delivered and the passionate attendees who soak themselve in the spirit of VMworld to learn and share together.

## Moving Forward
Its almost coming to my 3rd year in VMware and I am truly humbled to be given the chance to work at VMware and experience a journey like this. Being able to see how VMware grew from a company that focuses heavily on software virtualization into cloud business and now into the application and security space is truly mindblowing for me. The level of speed and innovation that goes behind the scenes to deliver products that helps customers with their digital transformation initiative is what keeps me going.

I glad that my role as an SE allows me to stay clos
