The past year or so I had the chance to be involve in a couple of [Pivotal Container Services (PKS)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/1-7/index.html) with NSX-T proof of concept deployment. The main thing about these PoCs is that most of the time its more than just getting the platform up and running for your customers. In most cases, it requires some form of application in order to validate if the platform is working aspected and the various integrations are in place. As such, depending on the test cases of the customers the type of applications you need may vary.

As such, I decided to take some time to compile some of my commonly use kubernetes applications YAML file and also included links to several other community developed kubernetes applications.
